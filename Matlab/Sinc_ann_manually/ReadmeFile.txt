File dL_manually:
	Build manually a Multilayer Perceptron with Deep Learning Toolbox and 
    then classify a whole DataSet. Print Confusion Matrix to check 
    classification distribution.

Manually Standardize with Saved Parameters
 If your Classification Learner model already standardized during training, 
 you need to apply the same mu and sigma to new data. Additionally, 
 standardization helps in improving the convergence speed of gradient 
 descent-based algorithms by ensuring that all features contribute equally 
 to the model

Sequence Files:
First execute manually build model and CM
then export the model manually build.
Use it for sensitive
For Ranking model is not needed.
